# Responsive-Portfolio

The responsive portfolio has helped me with realizing some of the details that go into to making web pages that I had not even considered before. In this activity we focus on using the media queries to help in resizing the web page itself for the purpose on being viewed on other devices.

To start things off I included `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` in my html sheets. 

For my CSS page 

I included the code 
@media screen and (max-width: ) three times with three different max widths at 980px, 768px, and 640px. 

The code for the 640px was the most dificult to adjust due to getting all the margins and images to fit
